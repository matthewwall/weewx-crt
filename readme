crt is a weeWX extension that emits a realtime.txt file in the format
specified by Cumulus

  http://wiki.sandaysoft.com/a/Realtime.txt

This extension can output three different files:

  realtime.txt
  realtime.xml
  sunbird


===============================================================================
Installation

1) install the extension

  weectl extension install https://github.com/matthewwall/weewx-crt/archive/master.zip

2) restart weewx


===============================================================================
Permissions

Be sure that the user running weeWX has permission to write the CRT file(s).
The default location for the files is /var/tmp, but if you change this to a
different location, the user running weeWX must be able to write to that
directory.


===============================================================================
Configuration options

Specify options in the CumulusRealTime section of the weeWX configuration file.

The default configuration emits only realtime.txt to /var/tmp/realtime.txt
To emit the XML or sunbird files, specify them in the CRT configuration stanza.

[CumulusRealTime]
    realtime_txt = /path/to/realtime.txt
    realtime_xml = /path/to/realtime.xml
    sunbird = /path/to/sunbird.txt

The default configuration binds to loop packets.  If you use CRT with a driver
that emits partial packets, you may see many NULL values.  Bind to archive
records to get full packet data.

[CumulusRealTime]
    binding = archive    # default is 'loop'

Control the units using settings for unit_system or individual observations.

[CumulusRealTime]
    unit_system = (US | METRIC | METRICWX)
    wind_units = (meter_per_second | mile_per_hour | km_per_hour | knot)
    temperature_units = (degree_C | degree_F)
    pressure_units = (hPa | mbar | inHg)
    rain_units = (mm | inch)
    cloudbase_units = (foot | meter)

For details about options, see the documentation in the crt.py file.
