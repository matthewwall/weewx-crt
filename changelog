* graceful recovery when no forecast binding defined
* refactor unit conversions to support per-observation unit specifications
* more fixes from gary for better unit conversions and cumulus compliance

0.17 28mar2016
* lots of fixes from gary roderick:
* Introduced StrictVersion to more easily compare weewx version numbers.
* crt now requires weewx 3.2.0 or later.
* Fixed UNITS_RAIN typo, weewx rain unit is 'inch' not 'in'.
* Added UNITS_ALT to facilitate cloudbase units lookup.
* Replaced knottoBeaufort() with call to weewx.wxformulas.beaufort().
* cloudbase, maxSolarRad, humidex, appTemp and heatindex are now included in
  weewx loop packets so removed manual calculations of these obs.
* Side benefit of using maxSolarRad from loop packet means crt no longer
  crashes if pyephem is not installed.
* Reworked calcDaylightHours() to use Almanac objects
  rather than Sun object calcs so that additional accuracy of pyephem can be
  taken advantage of if installed.
* Weewx is now windrun aware though windrun is not included in loop packets.
* Reworked windrun unit conversions to make use of weewx API.
* Sunshine hours calculations remain flawed but it now uses an Almanac
  object as the basis for its calculation.
* radiation had no formatting applied resulting in numerous decimal places
  in realtime.txt, reduced that to 1 decimal place (probably only an issue
  with simulator).
* Minor changes to some packet names to reflect new fields now in weewx loop
  packet eg cloud_base v cloudbase.
* Found that crt would fail if used with an empty archive (could not get db
  US units to do conversion so _cvt() method would cause a failure). Was a
  vicious circle; if used with an empty archive crt would cause weewx to fail
  and because weewx failed you could never get any records into the archive.
  The only work around was to not install/run crt on an empty archive. I
  reworked the _cvt() method to return None is the archive has no records,
  gives a lot of NULLs in the output until you get records in the archive then
  it operates as normal.
* Did some further comparison of Cumulus realtime.txt wiki page and Cumulus
  Webtags wiki page. By cross referencing the Webtags between the wiki pages
  it was possible to confirm details of a number of realtime.txt fields:
   - field 6 (wind avg speed)and field 47 (wind avg dir). Averaging period is
     not mentioned directly although the corresponding Webtags use 10 minute
     averages by default. This confirms current crt settings.
   - field 52 (avg_wind_dir). This is the compass direction of the 10 min
     average wind bearing, changed code to reflect this.
   - Cumulus uses wind direction of 0+ to 360 with 0 indicating calm.
* Reworked calcAvgWindDir() and calc10MinAvgWindDir() to return None or
  0+ to 360 rather than None or 0 to 360-.
* Given the way Cumulus represents wind direction introduced
  data['cumulus_windDir'] mainly to differentiate from/not overwrite
  data['windDir']
* Confirmed that month and year rain are month to date and year to date
  values from 1st of month and year respectively. Removed 2 related FIXME
  comments.
* field 11 is listed as in the realtime.txt wiki page as 'barometer (The
  sea level pressure)' with the equivalent webtag of #press. #press is listed
  in the webtags wiki page as 'The sea level pressure'. These are completely
  consistent with using weewx 'barometer'. Removed the comment re uncertainty
  over what pressure is specified in realtime.txt.
* Observed a number of real world live realtime.txt files and confirmed that:
   - realtime.txt uses local time. Reworked date/time to use local time
     throughout.
   - None/NULL handling is not specified in Cumulus realtime.txt wiki but
     observation of a number of realtime sites showed that when there is no
     wind, wind speeds are set to 0 not NULL. Introduced 'none' setting in
     weewx.conf	[CumulusRealTime] to allow user specification of what
     character/sequence of
     characters will be displayed in place of 'None' values in realtime.txt.
     Default setting is NULL.
   - Confirmed that Cumulus replaces compass points with '---' if it is
     calm/no wind. Implemented this via change to format()
